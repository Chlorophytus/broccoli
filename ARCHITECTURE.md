# Broccoli's Architecture
## TBD

Things will change frequently. This is just a brainstorming page...

## Texture Cells

The Broccoli picture processor is a 2D sprite-based powerhouse.

Each texture cell will compute X/Y pixel/coordinate data based on a matrix
and a 64x64 8-bit pixel memory.

## Particle Cells (TBD)

Minimal, less DSP48-hungry version of a texture cell. Specifics decided later.

## Shaders (TBD)

The texture and particle cells can be manipulated procedurally by a pixel
equation. The specifics will be decided on later.
