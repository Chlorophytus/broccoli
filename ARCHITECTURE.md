# Broccoli's Architecture
## TBD
Things will change frequently. This is just a brainstorming page...

## Texture Cells
The Broccoli picture processor is a 2D sprite-based powerhouse.

Each texture cell will compute X/Y pixel/coordinate data based on a matrix
and a 16x16 8-bit pixel memory.

## Shaders (TBD)
The texture cells can be manipulated procedurally by a pixel equation.
The specifics will be decided on later.
